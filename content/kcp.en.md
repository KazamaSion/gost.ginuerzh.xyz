KCP is a transport type supported by GOST.

Support for KCP is based on libraries [xtaci/kcp-go](https://github.com/xtaci/kcp-go) and [xtaci/kcptun](https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun).

Server:

```bash
gost -L=kcp://:8388
```

Client:

```bash
gost -L=:8080 -F=kcp://server_ip:8388
```

## Configuration

GOST has a default KCP configuration built-inï¼Œand is the same as xtaci/kcptun.

GOST will automatically load `kcp.json` configuration file from current working directory if exists, or you can use the parameter `c` to specify the path to the file.

```bash
gost -L=kcp://:8388?c=/path/to/conf/file
```

File format:

```json
{
    "key": "it's a secrect",
    "crypt": "aes",
    "mode": "fast",
    "mtu" : 1350,
    "sndwnd": 1024,
    "rcvwnd": 1024,
    "datashard": 10,
    "parityshard": 3,
    "dscp": 0,

{{< admonition title="NOTE" type="warning" >}}
To use a KCP node in a proxy chain, there can be only one KCP node in the proxy chain, and this node can only serve as the first node in the proxy chain.
